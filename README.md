# CANON SSDP

canon-ssdp implements all what's needed to make a Canon Powershot Wifi
camera connect to a non Windows system and allows to run a program
after the camera is connected.

The known cameras are listed in configuration file (canon-sspd.conf by
default) with the corresponding command to run.
